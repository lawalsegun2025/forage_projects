## BCG Data Science  & Analytics (customer churn prediction)

This project involves creating a predictive classification model for a client to determine which customers are likely to churn using customer data set and pricing data set.

This workflow involved 4 tasks;

### 1. Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
> - Understanding the business contex and problem statement.
> - Skills gained; `Business Understanding` `Hypothesis Framing` `Communication`

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
> - Understandibg the business through data
> - Skills gained; `Programming` `Exploratory Data Analysis`

### 3. Feature Engineering & Modeling
> - Uncovering signals within the data. 
> - Predicting customer churn probability and evaluating model performance.
> - Skills gained; `Creativity` `Mathematical Modeling` `Model Evaluation`

### 4. Findings & Recommendations
> - Presenting your results and giving recommended actions to the client
> - Skills gained; `Synthesis` `Client Communication` `Model Interpretation`
